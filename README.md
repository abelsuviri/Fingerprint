# Fingerprint

This is a fingerprint sample project. 

This app has a login screen with username abel and password test. If Android system version is lower than Marshmallow or device has not got fingerprint sensor then it has only traditional login options. If device has fingerprint sensor after doing login it will show a dialog to enroll fingerprint for next times. When fingerprint has been enrolled then it will show fingerprint login dialog each time we open the app.
